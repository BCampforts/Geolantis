    "\n",
    "Landlab model grids are 2D data structures that represent the model domain. A few things to know about grid management:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grids are Python <i>objects</i>\n",
    "- Grids use flat arrays\n",
    "- Grids are comprised of <i>elements</i> such as nodes and links (see Figure)\n",
    "- Grids are generated from the user-specified geometry of nodes\n",
    "- Data fields can be attached to grid elements\n",
    "- Methods are functions to perform operations on the data fields\n",
    "- There are regular (raster, radial, and hexgonal) and irregular (Voronoi-Delauney) grid types\n",
    "- Grids have some built-in numerical functions, such as gradient and divergence\n",
