    "## Goal\n",
    "*What?* Through the Geolantis project, students will investigate the question how tectonic and climate variability are expressed and preserved in topography. \n",
    "\n",
    "*How?* The goal of these sessions is to become familiar to landscape evolution modeling software. Students will work in groups on selected topics and processes influencing the evolution of landscapes. Each group will investigate a selected number of processes. A shared report will document findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who?* You! I am only providing a rough framework on how to do this. It is up to you and your creativity to get the details right. \n",
    "\n",
    "*When?* Common sessions on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Finalizing the report and final model before deadline. \n",
